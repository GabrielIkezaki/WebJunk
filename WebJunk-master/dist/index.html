                What can I say? It's a water bottle, except that it costs your kidney.
                There isn't anything "weird" or "junky" in particular about this product,
                but hey, it's expensive as all hell, and it fits the whole "Vaporwave"
                theme going on in this website, so... Why not? Also, this item is just
                an example.

                        Yep, you read that right. It's friggin' Unicorn Meat. Is it leggit? I dunno. I mean,
                         according to their website, hell yeah it's leggit. So...Yeah, I mean, why wouldn't
                         it? According to the website where I found this product, the little can is packed 
                         with love, sunshine, happiness, stars, hugs, dreams, dead unicorns, you name it. It's
                         described to taste like chicken, but with "a hint of marshmallow sweetness", so you 
                         might wanna figure out what that tastes like. Warning: the Web Junk Society does NOT
                         take responsability for item consumption. Also, they ran out of meat... But you can
                         still take a look at it.
